WHOAP! is a hybrid game. The board game is available in web browser (it means it is usable on tablet) and cards are purely physical.



> Half of the players must try to get the Kaisershiff to the other side of treacherous space while the others will do everything to destroy it. Find your team mates and stay away from the Asteroids!
